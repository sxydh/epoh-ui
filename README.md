# What is EpohUI

EpohUI is a cross-platform framework implemented in C#, designed to integrate the capabilities of browsers and system interfaces.

## What Can EpohUI Do

* Lightweight HTTP Server  
  EpohUI is primarily a minimal HTTP server, allowing you to browse the applicationâ€™s directories and files.  
  This means you can directly deploy web applications within the app, such as Vue, React, Angular, or even just write a native HTML file.  
  
* Call System Interfaces  
  EpohUI allows you to call system interfaces via HTTP protocol, such as IO, Net, Database, Thread, Process, etc.  
  
* Call Custom Interfaces  
  In addition to calling system interfaces, EpohUI can dynamically invoke user-defined interfaces without the need to compile or package the entire application.  

## How to Use EpohUI  

Using EpohUI is very simple, just one step:  

* Place EpohUI.Core.exe in the folder containing index.html, and run EpohUI.Core.exe to access the application homepage.  

If you need to call system interfaces, it's also very easy:  

```JavaScript
// The path lib/hello-world is the unique identifier for the system interface
fetch("http://localhost:33/api/lib/hello-world")
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(data => {
    // Here you can get the return value of the system interface
    console.log(data);
  });
```

If you need to call custom interfaces, just follow these two steps:  

* Copy your user DLL files into the DLLs folder.
* Call via HTTP.
